# MERN Stack Application

## Project Description
As the bootcamp has reached its climax, a test was put forward to test our knowledge and capabilities by having us create a MERN Stack single-page application. The overall idea is to have a landing page which offers some form of functionality, whilst also maintaining a database of users that are able to possibly make payments. 

## Conceptual Idea
The direction which i took this challenge was retail. The application built is an online store which offers different coffees from arounf the world for people to purchase. Individuals also have their own profiles allowing them to have personiled experiences. 

The vision for this site is to create a functioning green coffee market which displays the overall market prices as well predictions and news coverage of those particualar regions which the coffees cover.
